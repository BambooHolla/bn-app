    <p class="en title">Important Note: </p>
    <p class="zh level-1">在您使用IBT节点软件之前，请仔细阅读使用说明，创建账户之后自行备份您的主密码，并妥善保管您的主密码。为了确保您的账户安全，IFMChain协议中链上无法存储您的主密码，正是由于这一安全机制，IBT节点软件无法给您提供密码找回功能。如因您个人直接或间接导致主密码丢失、遗忘或被盗，由此引起的一切风险、责任、损失、费用等应由您自行承担。一旦您完成主密码生成、开始使用IBT节点软件，即表示您同意遵守本协议之所有规定，您对使用您的账号所进行的任何操作和后果承担全部责任。 </p>
    <p class="en level-1">You are advised to carefully read the user manual of IBT before using the program, and backup your master password and keep it in a safe place after creating your account. For the safety of your account, IFMChain is designed not to store any master passwords. This safety mechanism means that IBT cannot be used to retrieve your master password. In the event that your master password has been lost, forgotten, or stolen--whether you have played a direct or indirect role in this is irrelevant, all risks, liabilities, losses, costs etc. that may arise therefrom shall be borne by you. By using IBT after having generated your master password, you acknowledge that you agree to all the terms and conditions under this Agreement and that you shall be fully legally responsible for any activity that you conduct with your account and bear all the consequences that may result therefrom. </p>
